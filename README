# Tag Enumeration

This program takes in a given text file and extracts the tag types and the text elements surround. 
It consists of 3 main files:
1. the header file - XMLParse2.h - functin and variable declarations
2. the source file - XMLParse2.cpp - containing the functions definitions
3. the driver file - driver.cpp - which contains the main method.

A makefile is also included for the compilation of the files.
## How to use

The program can be compiled from the terminal using the 'make' command. 
This will generate a "driver.exe" ffile which is the file to run the program.
This file can be run using "./driver.exe". There is no make run command.
```
### XMLParse2.h file

This file contains the function declarations for 2 functions, namely readFile 
and parse. It also contains the definition for the TagStruct structure which 
will be used to store the data exxtracted from the files.

### XMLParse2.cpp file

This stores the body of each function declared in the header file.

readFile - takes in a string filename, opens the file and reads each line into 
		   a string vector. This string vector is returned.
parse - takes in the string vector from the readFile method and checks each 
		character line by line to extract the tags and data. once a tag is 
		found it is added to its appropiate place in a TagStruct vector which is
		returned by the function once the entire file has been cycled through.
TagStruct - this is a struct to store data for each tag. Namely ID (the name of the
			tag), numTags (the number of times the tag appears in given file) and
			text (which stores the text enclosed by each tag).

### Driver file

This contains the main method which uses an infinite loop to display a menu which
provides the user with commands that may be used.
